👋 Welcome!
Thank you for taking the time to explore this repository.
This project is not a full production framework — it’s a curated snippet of my real‑world automation work, prepared specifically for recruitment and portfolio purposes.

My goal here is to give you a clear sense of:
  - how I structure automation projects
  - how I design fixtures, clients, and abstractions
  - how I approach API testing and validation
  - how I write clean, expressive, and reliable test code

Everything you see in this repository reflects the same principles I apply in full‑scale, production‑ready frameworks: clarity, consistency, modularity, and thoughtful architecture.

To protect confidential information, internal business logic, and proprietary systems, I’ve extracted and adapted only the parts that are safe to share publicly. The patterns, however, are authentic — this is how I build automation in real projects.

If you’d like to discuss the design decisions, my broader experience, or how I approach automation in complex environments, I’d be happy to walk you through it.

Thanks again for visiting — enjoy exploring the code!
